# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition on FER2013 and CK+ dataset using CNN architecture

# Dowload Dataset from here
FER2013 https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data
CK+ dataset https://www.pitt.edu/~emotion/ck-spread.html

# Usage
1. Download both the dataset
2. Use csv_to_images.py file to convert train.csv file to image folder in which images will be saved according to image_label
3. Use OutputFolder_to_Separate_Emotion_Folders.py file to separate each image to its respective class folders
4. Use Model.py to train the network
5. Use Facial Expresion Detection.py file to test your trained model
6. Result of Emotion Recognition Model.docx contains few test results of my trained model

# Result
Validation Accuracy on FER2013:68%

Validation Accuracy on CK+dataset:97%
